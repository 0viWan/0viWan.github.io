-  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

   Wireframing and creating an HTML page always comes with its own set of self-doubts since many of us are very new to this experience so working together on an HTML page and its wireframe together defenitely makes the experience a little less daunting; you are able to collectively pool your knowledge in the subject matter, share ideas, and therefore apply what you individually best see fit. Wireframing is a little bit tricky as well though; everyone seems to be using different mediums in order to do the task; some are software integrated into browsers, others are downloadable programs and they range from slightly to largely different. That coupled with variations in how people want to display their blogs and you are bound to get a lot of variation and conflicting directions on how to proceed with the project. I think that I enjoy collaborating with people on the HTML structure of this activity because of the uncertainty many of us are having with some of the aspects of the language (ie. How do we properly use semantic elements of HTML5?). Though we will inevitably have variations in our respective code; we get to decipher what we think goes best in each others' formula.

-  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

   I do in fact believe that wireframing is helpful to the development process because it provides the visual framework for all the proceeding steps in the development process. I'm sure it's easy to get ahead of yourself and want to just dive into the build of a website; but having now actually made one I see how it can really give you direction and foresight into your end-goal. I also see that a wireframe is a 'loose template'; you might initially have an idea for the flow of information of your website but then later have creative differences. You might see something as counter-intuitive, visually distracting, extraneous, or even see the need for something you did not initially even think of. Having a wireframe should not be a restrictive part of the process but rather something to held keep you on track. 

-  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

   A lack of clutter; it's easy to loose sight of the forrest from the trees so it's best when in doubt to keep it simple. A good wireframe makes you understand the creative flow of information with minimal words/text. In fact any real text included is generally either a placeholder (to diagram a blog post for example) or a tentative working title/header. This prevents the designer from getting sidetracked with the actual content that will eventually be included and rather focus on the skeleton of the site. You should be able to largely understand how you would move around the site without a lot of clarification. Most wireframing tools have easily implementable objects in their roster that will stand for the same thing everytime you use it in your wireframe plan. For example most wireframe tools have a rectangular box with an 'x' through it. This will always refer to an image that is implemented into your future website. That said, I decided it was best to use those visual representations appropriately as it would make sense in the final version. 

-  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

   I think that at this point I am still constantly learning about semantic elements and how to use them appropriately. There is definitely a learning curve to this and I find myself looking things up constantly or asking the guides for further clarification on how to use them appropriately. It can get rather confusing how 'article' is different from 'section' and things like that so I am abiding by the mantra of "practice makes perfect" and learning about the correct syntax by building things through trial and error.  I am still very much at a loss when trying to explain how to use "div" properly.
