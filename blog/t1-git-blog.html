  <h1>Version Control and its Beloved Children, Git and GitHub</h1>

        In order to extoll the boundless virtues of 'version control', one must first understand what those words mean. Version Control is a component of software that manages the entire range of changes to documents, computer programs, websites, and other amasses of information by tracking and controlling changes to source code. This ability has overarching implications in the key functionality of everything from word processors and spreadsheets, to the amazingly complex version control budding to veteran software developers utilize in GitHub. The sheer fact that version control exists allows projects to be done collaboratively, efficiently, and harmoniously over forums such as GitHub. Let's analyze this a bit further: Imagine a huge software development project with a litany of moving parts and corresponding teams to design and deploy everything. Version Control becomes key in its allowance to have teams simultaneously working on iterations of the same software and its updates. This overlap between the same source code inevitably allows for the possibility of bugs; Version Control further lets users locate and isolate bugs since the documentation it provides allows retrieval of prior software versions in order to see at which stage errors were created in.  Ain't that nifty? Moreover, though version control can technically be implemented manually by developers, this is generally inefficient and prone to human error.  Version Control automates it all and gives you time to do more importantly things, like code and brush your teeth. Now you have no excuses with those back molars the next time you pay the dentist a visit. I don't know about you, but I lose my self control over version control... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HInA9jKyoKE

        Now that we've so broadly discussed Version Control, let's zone in on the free, open-source, and virtually universally used form of it we will be getting down to the nitty-gritty with: git. Git is so widely used and industry leading because of its inherent speed and efficiency, data integrity, and its integrated ability to accommodate simultaneous, non-linear workflow amongst large groups of collaborators. 
        In order to show you how changes in git are made, I am going to describe how git generally works. Compared to other version control systems, git does not store data as a set of changes over time to the base version of each file. Git treats data like photographs of your file ecosystem. 'Commits' (saves) in git act as snaps of all your files in that instance and stores that as a reference point. This crucial difference allows for some very intricate filing of your work, and the ability to see "freeze frames" of your work almost as if you had a time machine. Take that Delorean!
        Changes made to your files in git fall under three main categories: committed, modified, and staged. 'Committed' means that data is residing locally in your database. 'Modified' is when the file has been altered but not yet committed to the database. 'Staged' signifies that modified files have been prepped to go into your next save 'commit' snap. 
        These distinctions lead into an important segue regarding the various locales during the life of a git project that result in priming your data for a safe and secure save. 1) The 'git directory' is the hub that stores the integral metadata and object database of the project. 2) The 'working directory' can be thought of like a like a piece of paper you are writing on/editing; it acts a singular read of one version of the project you are working on. These files are extracted from the git directory and placed on your local disk to edit at your disposal. Finally, 3) the 'staging area' exists as an intermediary between the prior two directories. It is a file contained in the git directory that stores the data regarding what is being submitted into your next commit, and is also referred to as an 'index'.
        The general order of operations with workflow becomes:

        1) Make changes to the file in the working directory
        2) Stage the files by "taking pictures" of them in the staging area.
        3) Commit the files from the staging area permanently to the git directory.

        Voila! This process which you now know about will accompany you on the road time and time again to developing meaning projects in git.

        Why use GitHub? More like: Why NOT use GitHub? GitHub is a industry-standard social network for programmers that allows individuals and enterprises to store their source code in a secure place. GitHub is a VCS (Version Control System) and also the world's largest online storage space of collaborative code projects. Being a VCS, this means that through GitHub you are able to host code, track issues and changes to said code, and collaborate on the documentation of your projects. Definitely no small potatoes. In this sense, not only can the budding programmer display his/her projects to the world, get help from more experienced developers, and can also build and riff off the works of tech titans like Google and Facebook. Furthermore GitHub ensures the proprietary rights of the developer; it has the most most widely recognized as best 'terms of service' in the social media realms, and guarantees the ownership of work uploaded to the site. GitHub is like the best friend you never knew you had!; fearlessly protecting you, proudly displaying your achievements to the world, and giving you insight and recommendations in the endless sea of code projects all around you.  How cool is that?
