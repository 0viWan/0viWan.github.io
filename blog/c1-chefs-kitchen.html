  <h1>Musings about DBC: Thoughts and Expectations</h1>
  <h2>Week 1</h2>

      My take on the DBC experience are the feelings of 'excitement' with 'nervous apprehension' in equal measure. More than anything I am excited to gain skillsets that currently seem so foreign to me and be amazed by my personal progress down the road. I am an avid believer in perpetual 'self-improvement'; I think that the art of learning really never ends as long as you live and I am engaged to discovering more insight into my psyche, personality/behavior, and my wherewithal to face the challanges ahead. I am nervous just because I understand that this journey is no cakewalk: no reward without great work and perseverance. I have been working for a while, and though that comes with its own set of hardships I have not been in "school-mode" for a while and getting back into that mindset has its own rigors. Just this week I had to sit down and ponder my time/scheduling after hitting the ground running with DBC work and my responsibilites at my job, and realizing that something had to give. I made the choice to scale back my hours at work and truly believe I am making the best decision. My education takes top priority!

      I am actually very excited with engaging myself in the culture of DBC because I am largely an extrovert and I find the idea of partner pairing not very daunting. I like talking to people, being social, and working in teams; what I am scared of is looking like a fool in front of my peers. I strive to contribute something of meaning, but I do at times question my value in settings where I feel someone has a 'head start' or is just technically more proficient in the subject matter. I undertand that we are all in this together; I have to realize and constantly remind myself that my struggles are not singular to me, that questions are vital to learning, to have a voice when problems arrise, and accepting that mistakes are just part of the overall process. Nothing to be ashamed about.

      My expectations of DBC have not really changed as of yet; I know I am still such a neophyte to this program (or as they say in the Star Wars universe, "Padawan") but everything I have experienced thus far hasn't come as a huge surprise. I had a moment though this past where I had glowing sense of satisfaction with my fearless sense of learning how to navigate the command line. "Woah, I am actually doing this. A week ago I didn't understand what any of this really was. Cool!" Overall I am stoked to be here and moreover, thrilled to get to know everyone better as the weeks progress! Cheers!
