    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <div class= "column1">
    <p> Hey There! I'm Ovi Calvo and I am currently living in the beautiful city of San Francisco. I am (mostly) a Bay Area native and spent much of my formative years in the sleepy town of Saratoga in the tech-centric epicenter that is the South Bay. Going back even further, I spent my early childhood years in Guam. For those of you unfamiliar with the American-territory, Guam is a 212 square mile oasis in the Western Pacific island chain of Micronesia. I think these disparate locales of my upbringing fostered two distinct appreciations at my core: a loving dichotomy for both technology and the hyper-new, and a passion for the natural world and the slower moments in life.
    </p>
    <p> I like a great deal of things! Just ask me sometime: I'm an open book. Some of those things are (but not limited to): cooking and general food experimentation, language immersion, keyboards and synths, gaming (video and board), hiking/camping, yoga, swimming, illustration/design, dogs, and currently exploring every nook and cranny of programming culture.
    </p>
    <p> Dev Bootcamp is the first post-graduate study I have undertaken since matriculating (funny word) from UC Davis. I studied Food Science and Japanese. I have a deep respect for the likes of Alton Brown and Michael Pollan.
    </p>
    <p> A fun factoid about me: I am a bonafide Star Wars enthusiast. In the trivia gaming app 'QuizUp', for a while I was ranked as one of the top-10 Star Wars players in California. I also love a good joke or pun. You know, a steak-pun is a rare medium well-done. :-)

    May the Force be with you, always.
    </p>
